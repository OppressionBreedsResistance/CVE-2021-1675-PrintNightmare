# CVE-2021-1675-PrintNightmare
Working PowerShell POC

Powershell script is copied from https://github.com/calebstewart/CVE-2021-1675
Respect for Caleb Stewart and John Hammond. 


I just wanted to have working poc close at hand. Ive added my custom DLL and an obfuscated version of powershell script. 

Obfuscated script loads DLL named "printed.dll" from "C:\windows\tracing" directory.
